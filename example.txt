Newhaven, Village Entrance
    Welcome to Newhaven! You are standing at the crude wooden gates of the
village entrance, in the middle of a dusty path. A low wooden palisade
surrounds the village, to protect against creatures of the night and random
raiders. You can see small buildings to the north and south, and a dusty path
that leads to the west and southeast.
